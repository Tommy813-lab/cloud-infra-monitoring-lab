üß† Cloud Infra Monitoring Lab

Hands-on AWS monitoring lab for Cloud Support Engineers and aspiring Infrastructure Pros.
Simulate real-world monitoring of a web app running on EC2, with custom metrics, dashboards, CloudWatch alarms, and SNS notifications. Sharpen your troubleshooting instincts and catch incidents before they become outages.

üìå Scenario

You are a Cloud Support Engineer at a mid-size e-commerce company. A marketing campaign is driving sudden traffic spikes. Your task:

Monitor EC2 health: CPU, memory, disk usage.

Alert on high CPU before users complain.

Notify the on-call engineer via SNS.

Build dashboards for leadership to showcase uptime metrics.

Your mission: Proactive monitoring with real-world AWS tooling. üöÄ

Logic Flow:

Users generate traffic ‚Üí EC2 processes requests.

CloudWatch Agent collects metrics in real-time.

CloudWatch evaluates thresholds ‚Üí triggers alarms.

SNS sends alerts ‚Üí on-call engineer receives notification.

Dashboards visualize system health.

üöÄ Deployment Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch EC2 & SSH
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name my-key \
  --security-groups my-sg

ssh ec2-user@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Apache & CloudWatch Agent
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd amazon-cloudwatch-agent
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure CloudWatch Agent
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
  -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c file:cloudwatch-agent-config.json -s

4Ô∏è‚É£ Create CloudWatch Alarms & SNS Notifications

Example: High CPU Alarm

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name HighCPUUtilization \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 80 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<INSTANCE_ID> \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:MyTopic

‚úÖ Success Criteria

Alerts trigger when CPU > 80%.

Email/SMS notifications received immediately.

Dashboards update in near real-time.

You feel like a CloudWatch ninja ü•∑.
